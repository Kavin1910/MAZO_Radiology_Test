# Authentication Issues Fixed

I've resolved both the sign-in functionality and Account creation UI issues:

## Fixed Authentication Problems:
- **Supabase URL Configuration**: Corrected the project URL to match your actual Supabase instance
- **"Failed to fetch" Errors**: Authentication requests should now work properly
- **Session Management**: Proper auth state handling with user persistence

## Improved UI/UX:
- **Clean Form Design**: Removed problematic CSS classes, simplified layout
- **Better Form Fields**: Proper icons, validation, and error messages
- **Password Security**: Toggle visibility, strength validation, confirmation matching
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during authentication process
- **Smooth Navigation**: Easy switching between login/register modes

## What's Working Now:
✅ Sign in with email/password
✅ Create new accounts with profile data
✅ Form validation and error handling
✅ Clean, responsive UI design
✅ Proper session management

Try signing in or creating a new account - the authentication should work smoothly now!
